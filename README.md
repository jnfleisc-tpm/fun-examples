# fun-examples
This is a github repo with my software experiments and examples based on training I am taking.

This isn't intended to be an extensive portfolio.  I am currently a Technical Program Manager
who has some time to get more hands-on with some of the concepts involved in programs I
lead.  Since I believe the more in-depth knowledge one has the more effective one can be
(and the more fun one has :-)), I have started this repo.
